* New feature - Attempt History

    This adds settings so that a student can have build up a history of separate submission attempts and grades for the same
    asistenciasment.

    Extra settings on the asistencias table are:
    attemptreopenmethod - The way attempts can be reopened. One of:
                            ASISTENCIAS_ATTEMPT_REOPEN_METHOD_NONE - Attempts cannot be reopened (default)
                            ASISTENCIAS_ATTEMPT_REOPEN_METHOD_UNTIL_PASS - Attempts are reopened on grading until the gradebook
                                                                      indicates this student has passed.
                            ASISTENCIAS_ATTEMPT_REOPEN_METHOD_MANUAL - Attempts are reopened on manually by the grader.
    maxattempts - The maximum allowed number of attempts per student for this asistencias instance.

    Extra settings on the submission and grade records:
    attemptnumber - Starting from 0 until the latest attempt.
